# VBA_coding_KPI
This code corresponds to a macro which was created to automate the obtention of a KPI (Keep Performance Indicator).
Basically, the code performs the following actions:<br>
-it opens two Excel files. The first one **(Excel_1) contains the needed information, and the second one (Excel_2) is used to copy the information in it and update the chart.<br>
-Filters the red cells in the **Excel_1<br>
-Transfers several columns from **Excel_1 to **Excel_2.<br>
-Deletes the duplicated rows in **Excel_2<br>
-Sorts the rows by their date in **Excel_2<br>
-Contabilizes the number of rows in <b>Excel_2<br>
-Places the value in another sheet in <b>Excel_2 in order to update the chart<br>
-Prints the chart of the <b>Excel_2<br>
-Closes all the Excel files<br>

Due to confideality, I am not able to upload the Excel_1 and the Excel_2 files on this repository.<br>
