# VBA_coding_KPI
This code corresponds to a macro which was created to automate the obtention of a KPI (Keep Performance Indicator).
Basically, the code performs the following actions:<br>
-it opens two Excel files. The first one  contains the needed information, and the second one is used to copy the information in it and update the chart.<br>
-Filters the red cells in the opened file<br>
-Copies several columns to the other file.<br>
-Deletes the duplicated rows<br>
-Sorts the rows by their date<br>
-Contabilizes the number of rows<br>
-Places the value in another sheet in order to update the chart<br>
-Prints the chart<br>
-Closes all the Excel files<br>

Due to confideality, I am not able to upload the Excel files on this repository.<br>
